This project simulates a distributed inventory management system for a multi-store retail chain using MongoDB sharding.
Project Goal: Develop a system that tracks product inventory across multiple stores in a geographically distributed manner.

A)Database Design:
We will use four MongoDB collections: MainDB,Products,Inventory,Sell

1.MainDB
=======
Table: User, Branch, Location, Category,

2.Products Fragmention DB
======================
descirpiton : the product db will be fragmented base on different Category

Table: Product

3.Inventory Fragmentation DB
======================
descirpiton : the Inventory BD tables will be fragmented base on different branch

Table: stock, stock_item

4.Sell Fragmention DB
======================
descirpiton : the Sell DB tables will be fragmented base on different branch

Table: order, order_item

B)Procedure :

1.setting up mongo db instance for 4 Database
2.2.Data Population

4.Testing and Demonstration:

C)Benefits of using Sharding:
D)Additional Considerations:
E)Tools and Technologies:
